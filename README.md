### Shopping-Data-Analytics

This project gave an overview of shopping behavior and how consumers use promo-code and non-promo code when making purchases.

In the first part of this project I started cleaning missing data that included null values, and to find the results based of the consumers location and payment method. 

During the second part, data cleaning pivot tables were a good example of demonstrating the types of apperal that had the highest sales by season. 

In the data analysis, I concluded how promo code shoppers differ from non-promo code shoppers based on their overall spending. 

Some of the challenges that I encountered through the lab were removing and calling certain columns which did not give me accurate results, and having difficulty seperating the promo code and non-promo code column.
